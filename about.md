## Welcome! Nice to have you here

### How long will it take to get my webpage created from the day I assign it?

From the start date, it'll take from 2 to 4 weeks depending on the complexity of the webpage respectively. You just need to give your idea about your webpage and your business, all the other stuff is done automatically by your developer.
